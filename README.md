# prework-study-guide

## Description

During the prework exercise; the task was to creat a simple webpage which highlighs the rudimentary aspects of HTML, CSS & JS.

- The motivation comes a fasination of being able to instruct the computer to build or have an idea which can be visually repesented via codeing syntax.
- I did this project to get an idea of how user interface is repesented. Even though I have previous knoledge of HTML, CSS & JS; the other aspects of the exercise were an eye opener and much appriciated.
- Prior to the prework exercise, I did not use Linux commands, git commands or github website. 
The exercise was hands on exeprince of the three technolagies mentioned throughout; pushing files onto github using git commands, merging files, creating/navigating through files using Linux commands, creating new repository on Github, cloning repos using SSH keys and much more (there is only so much you can learn by reading).
